# Hello, I'm Stefan!

### **CompTIA Security+ Certified | Software & IT Student at FTN Novi Sad**

I am a final-year student at the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad, fully committed to a career in **cybersecurity** with a primary interest in **Security Operations (SOC)** and defensive security. While my academic background is in software engineering, I have dedicated my professional focus to threat detection, anomaly analysis, and protecting digital environments.
